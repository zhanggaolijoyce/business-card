This is my first html and css project, I finish it under Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/playlist/pKgWxCP)

It is to put a business card on a website, I need to design this card, like the layout of texts and picture, the border and the background and such things. 

I learned the basic structure and parts of a website and learned how to link a css file to html in order to customize the website. It is the beginning of my front-end leaning path, keep going Joyce!
